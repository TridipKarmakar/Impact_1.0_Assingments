f you're encountering an error message stating "This site can't be reached" with the message "raw.githubusercontent.com took too long to respond," it typically indicates a connection issue between your device and the GitHub server.

Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot the problem:

Check your internet connection: Ensure that you have a stable internet connection by visiting other websites or performing a speed test.

Clear your browser cache: Clearing your browser's cache can help resolve temporary issues. Go to your browser's settings and clear the cache and cookies.

Try a different browser or device: If the problem persists, attempt to access the raw.githubusercontent.com URL using a different browser or device. This can help determine if the issue is specific to your current browser or device.

Disable VPN or proxy: If you are using a VPN (Virtual Private Network) or a proxy server, try disabling them temporarily. Sometimes, these services can cause connectivity problems.

Check GitHub's status: Visit the GitHub Status page (https://www.githubstatus.com/) to check if there are any ongoing issues or outages with the GitHub service. If there is a known problem, you might need to wait until it's resolved.
